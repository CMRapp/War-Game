# War-Game
Repository for Promineo Tech BE Developer WK 6 Final Java Project. Program simulates a 2 player version of the classic card game War using a standard 52 card deck. Program written in Java using the Eclipse IDE.

## How The Program Works
This game automated, no user input is required. Game only plays 26 rounds. Once cards are played, they are removed from the deck.

A standard deck of 52 cards is dealt so that both players have 26 cards. In war, each card has one of thirteen possible predetermined values starting at two (the lowest value) through Ace (the highest value). Card suits are the traditional Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs & Spades.

During each round, both players play a card from the top of their hand face up. The player who plays the card of the higher rank wins the round. Unlike the traditional game where the losing player's cards are taken by the winner of the round, used are removed from play. The player with the highest value card wins a point for the round. If the player's cards are equal, no points are awarded. when the game is finished a winner or a draw is determined.
